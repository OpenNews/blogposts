# How to write blog posts on opennews.org

Writing blog posts on OpenNews is easy but requires knowing a few things about file formats and how Jekyll deals with blog posts.

## Creating a file

Blog posts are written in Markdown and need to be stored in the `_Posts` folder. In order for Jekyll to know what to do with them, files most follow this naming convention: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-FILE-NAME.md`. For an example from our actual blog, theres: `2014-10-22-announcing-2015-fellows.md`

Jekyll uses this file name to assign chronological order to the blog post, so it's important. The title itself doesn't matter a ton, but I find it's easier to just keep going with the hyphens. NO SPACES though--that won't work.
